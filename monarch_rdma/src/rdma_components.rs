//! # RDMA Components
//!
//! This module provides the core RDMA building blocks for establishing and managing RDMA connections.
//!
//! ## Core Components
//!
//! * `RdmaDomain` - Manages RDMA resources including context, protection domain, and memory region
//! * `RdmaQueuePair` - Handles communication between endpoints via queue pairs and completion queues
//!
//! ## RDMA Overview
//!
//! Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) allows direct memory access from the memory of one computer
//! into the memory of another without involving either computer's operating system. This permits
//! high-throughput, low-latency networking with minimal CPU overhead.
//!
//! ## Connection Architecture
//!
//! The module manages the following ibverbs primitives:
//!
//! 1. **Queue Pairs (QP)**: Each connection has a send queue and a receive queue
//! 2. **Completion Queues (CQ)**: Events are reported when operations complete
//! 3. **Memory Regions (MR)**: Memory must be registered with the RDMA device before use
//! 4. **Protection Domains (PD)**: Provide isolation between different connections
//!
//! ## Connection Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. Create an `RdmaDomain` with `new()`
//! 2. Create an `RdmaQueuePair` from the domain
//! 3. Exchange connection info with remote peer (application must handle this)
//! 4. Connect to remote endpoint with `connect()`
//! 5. Perform RDMA operations (read/write)
//! 6. Poll for completions
//! 7. Resources are cleaned up when dropped

/// Maximum size for a single RDMA operation in bytes (1 GiB)
